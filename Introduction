# Introduction to AWS

## Overview of AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.


## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Regions**: Geographical areas with multiple Availability Zones.
- **Availability Zones**: Isolated data centers within a region.
- **Edge Locations**: Locations used for content delivery.

## Benefits of AWS

### Scalability and Flexibility
AWS allows you to scale resources up or down based on demand.

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Operational excellence | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.                                    |

| Security               | The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.                                                                    |

| Reliability            | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS. |

| Performance efficiency | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.                                                                        |

| Cost optimization      | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.                                                                                                                                                    |

| Sustainability         | The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.           |
