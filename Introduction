# Introduction to AWS

## Overview of AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.


## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Regions**: Geographical areas with multiple Availability Zones.
- **Availability Zones**: Isolated data centers within a region.
- **Edge Locations**: Locations used for content delivery.

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) helps organizations understand how cloud adoption transforms the way they work and provides a structure to identify and address gaps in skills and processes. It offers guidance across six perspectives:

- **Business**: Aligns IT strategy with business goals. 
Also helps ensure that your cloud investments accelerate
your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes. Common
stakeholders include chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer
(CFO), chief operations officer (COO), chief information officer (CIO), and
chief technology officer (CTO).

- **People**: Focuses on organizational change management and the skills needed.
Serves as a bridge between technology and business,
accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve
to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes
business-as-normal, with focus on culture, organizational structure,
leadership, and workforce. Common stakeholders include CIO, COO, CTO,
cloud director, and cross-functional and enterprise-wide leaders.

- **Governance**: Ensures IT governance, risk management, and compliance.
Helps you orchestrate your cloud initiatives while
maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation-related
risks. Common stakeholders include chief transformation officer, CIO, CTO,
CFO, chief data officer (CDO), and chief risk officer (CRO).

- **Platform**: Focuses on cloud infrastructure and services.
Helps you build an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid
cloud platform; modernize existing workloads; and implement new cloud-
native solutions. Common stakeholders include CTO, technology leaders,
architects, and engineers.

- **Security**: Ensures cloud security and compliance.
Helps you achieve the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of your data and cloud workloads. Common stakeholders include
chief information security officer (CISO), chief compliance officer (CCO),
internal audit leaders, and security architects and engineers.

- **Operations**: Defines how IT operations are managed in the cloud.
Helps ensure that your cloud services are delivered
at a level that meets the needs of your business. Common stakeholders
include infrastructure and operations leaders, site reliability engineers,
and information technology service managers



## Benefits of AWS

### Scalability and Flexibility

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Operational excellence | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.                                    |

| Security               | The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.                                                                    |

| Reliability            | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS. |

| Performance efficiency | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.                                                                        |

| Cost optimization      | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.                                                                                                                                                    |

| Sustainability         | The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.           |
